# Precourse Work

Welcome to Telegraph Prep+! Our precourse material which will expose you to fundamental concepts of JavaScript that will stay with you for the rest of your software engineering career! 

Even if you are completely new to programming, this material will help you take the very first steps you need to master javascript. We begin by introducing you to Github and basic programming concept via Codeacademy. 

After completing the prerequisites, you will take a deeper dive into the basics you learned through Codecademy (primitives, operators, and variables in Javascript) and get more experience with practical application of what you learned. 

The goal is repetition until complete retention of the information is achieved. After you grasp the basics, you will then be introduced to core concepts that are vital in building programs in Javascript and you will pick up some engineering best practices such as learning how to properly [debug](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Debugging) your code.
